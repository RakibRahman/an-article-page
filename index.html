          The Importance Of Whitespace In Web Design & How To Properly Use Them
        </h1>
        <p>
          When designing a new website it’s essential to keep your pages clean,
          uncluttered, and easy to navigate. Today's website visitors are
          content-scanners. They scroll quickly, skim posts, and get distracted
          by busy layouts trying to accomplish too much. The key to getting your
          visitors' undivided attention is simplicity -- and that starts with an
          effective use of whitespace.
        </p>

      <p>
          In this article, we'll take a brief look at why whitespace matters, what
          it means for conversion-driven web design, and how to properly use
          whitespace to lead website visitors towards the desired action.
      </p>
        <h2>What is Whitespace in Web Design?</h2>
        <p>
          Whitespace in web design also known as negative space is the space
          within any design that doesn’t contain any screen element and won’t
          attract the attention of the user or reader. It does not literally
          mean an empty space with a white background. It can be of any color,
          texture, patterns or even a background image.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is the portion of the page left unmarked that separate each website
          content; the space between elements in a composition such as margins
          and gutters. It can be seen between columns, between lines of text or
          figures, buttons, images and videos, that provides visual breathing
          room for the eye.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is Whitespace Important?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most frustrating feelings is when there is too much content
          on a website and all of it is fighting for your attention without a
          clear and consistent separation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crowded and very busy websites are very difficult to read, making the
          users feel frustrated trying to find the right part of the page
          they’re interested in. It has been long understood that people are
          mostly scanning the content before they decide to read it. Whitespaces
          take a big part in making content scannable, which makes it more
          engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitespace also gives you an impression of a higher quality design.
          Websites that use whitespace seem to be more elegant and lighter. It
          has been a well-known practice within luxury brand websites to have
          larger whitespaces, making the designs look more elegant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitespaces are also often used for balancing the layout, bringing the
          visual integrity of the design.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          As a conclusion, I would like to add that a very good approach to
          using whitespaces is to perceive them as an active element on the
          website. Whitespaces are there to help with scanning the content,
          readability, make websites seem more elegant and improve user’s
          experience. So next time you feel that the whitespace has got to be
          filled with some content, think of it as an active website element,
          instead of a blank background, and use it consistently.
